
dataset:https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/Selfie/Selfie-dataset.tar.gz
The model folder contains this 
1- Memes classification.ipynb for( training and testing files )
2- model.tflite if run model on tensorflow 
3- model.h5 If run model in flask or any backend
4-dataset file
You don’t need ratrain and test model again because all outputs appears for in Memes classification .ipynb
but if you need ratrain and test model (yon could be use colab to run this Memes (classification.ipynb) file 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Flutter folder : don’t need for explains.
But Summary:

1- I used tflite package for loading model and predicted .
2- I used image_picker for uploading images.

note : 
before run main in flutter project you should do:
  - pub get 
  - pub upgrade 

For Denpendencies in file (pubspec.yaml)
